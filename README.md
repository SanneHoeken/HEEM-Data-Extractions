# HEEM-Data-Extractions

### Project

This project concerns an investigation into emotions in seventeenth-century plays in the Netherlands. In this project data is extracted from an already existing dataset: [the Historic Embodied Emotions Model (HEEM)](https://github.com/NLeSC/HEEM-dataset). This dataset was developed at the VU by the emotion expertise center ACCESS (under the supervision of Inger Leemans). The developers have labeled emotions through machine learning for 278 seventeenth-century and eighteenth-century plays, nine of which are of Spanish origin. 
The data extraction in this project serves to compare a few specific theater genres common in the Netherlands in the seventeenth century: 
- Spanish theater
- Senecaan-Scaligerian theater
- Vondel's theater
- Horror and Spectacle theater

The code in this project performs three different analyses for selected plays from the HEEM dataset:
1. Per text and genre it is broken down how often which concept types, emotion types, emotion clusters, body parts and sentiment types occur in numbers with respect to the number of terms in the text.
2. For seven emotions, it is plotted per genre which body parts are most strongly expressed.
3. For six pieces, the 'sentimental development' of a selection of characters is visualized.

## To work

### Requirements

This codebase is written entirely in Python 3.7. requirements.txt contains all necessary packages to run the code successfully. These are easy to install via pip using the following instruction:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

The results can be regenerated by calling:

```
python main.py
```

The program will prompt which of the three analyses you want to perform on the dataset. The results are stored in ./results.

### Structure

The following list describes the most important folders and files in the project, and where to find them:

- **emotion_references.py**: contains the code for the analysis of emotion references per text and per genre
- **embodied_emotions.py**: contains the code for plotting the emotion embodiment data by genre
- **sentiment_visualisation.py**: contains the code for visualizing the sentimental development in a play
- **/data**: contains selected files from the HEEM dataset
- **/results**: contains all the results of this project
- **/help_methods**: contains functions that are (or have been) needed in various programs

### Note

In the HEEM dataset, there is one file for Coster's works (cost001rako01_01.xml) containing the annotations of several of Coster's plays. Using the function *split_coster()* (click [here](https://github.com/SanneHoeken/HEEM-Data-Extractions/blob/master/help_methods/split_coster.py) for the implementation details) the annotations of four plays were extracted from this file and saved as separate files. These are the pieces Ithys, Iphigenia, Isabella and Polyxena; stored in [data](https://github.com/SanneHoeken/HEEM-Data-Extractions/tree/master/data/senecaans_scaligeriaans) as cost001rako01_ithys.xml, cost001rako01_iphigenia.xml, cost001rako01_isabella.xml and cost001rako01_polyxena.xml respectively.
